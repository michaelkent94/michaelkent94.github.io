    <h2>Hello interested blog reader!</h2>
    <p>I write about programming: my personal projects, things that seem interesting to me, maybe some news here and there. I want to provide tutorial-like information on some topics and simply my opinions and insights on others.</p>
  </div>

  <p>My name is Michael Kent and I'm a Software Developer. You may have noticed the Fred Brooks quote in the sidebar. That pretty much sums up how I feel about what I do. I love exploring new concepts, ideas, and technologies with software.</p>
  <p>Here's that same quote with a bit more at the end</p>
  <p class="inset-quote">"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structuresâ€¦ Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be."

  <p>It gives me chills every time I read it. This blog is dedicated to building castles in the air.</p>
